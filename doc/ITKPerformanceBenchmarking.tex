\begin{abstract} \noindent This document describes a module for the Insight
Toolkit (ITK) \url{www.itk.org} to assist in performance benchmarking and a
suite of benchmarks for the toolkit. These resources provide metrics to
quantify software computational performance. This is a pre-requisite to
improve performance either through algorithmic advancements or better
utilization of hardware resources.

Computional performance is quantified by reducing factors that confound timing
measurements and by estimating measurement variance. New classes are presented
that increase operating system process priority to minimize the impact of
other processes running on the system. System hardware characteristics are
extracted and displayed. The influence of hard disk input/output on runtime
measurements is removed in the suite of benchmarks. Additionally, the number
of threads used by each benchmark can be specified. These benchmarks consist
of common analysis pipelines and run on 3D magnetic resonance brain image data
so realistic performance is quantified. Benchmarks can be executed with
multiple iterations, and timing statistics are recorded in tab separated value
(.tsv) files, which are easily stored or processed for further analysis and
visualization.

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that the authors used for validating the algorithm described in
this paper. This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific
publications must facilitate reproducibility of the reported results.

\section{Introduction}

To make quantifiable improvements in computational software performance, the
performance must be measureable. This article describes performance
measurement tools in the Insight Toolkit (ITK,\url{www.itk.org}), and how they
are applied to benchmark scientific image analysis code. In addition, the
article also describes a suite of example benchmarks that quantify ITK image
processing pipeline performance. Informative performance metrics require
consideration of the behavior to be optimized and factors that influence
measurement of the desired behavior

The behavior this article focuses on is the time required to execute software
image analysis pipelines on realistic image datasets. Full pipelines are
benchmarked since this is what impacts the experience of software users. Hard
disk input/output (I/O) influence is removed from timings because it may not
be present in applications in the same form as the benchmarks. The data
processed is based on a 3D magnetic resonance
BrainWeb\cite{BrainWeb1,BrainWeb2} image, which has realistic size and
content. Benchmarks inputs and operations are also designed for a target
runtime of approximately 1-2 seconds for a single iteration and approximately
5-10 seconds for multiple iterations on current systems. These durations are
intended to be long enough for memory access and processing times to reach a
steady state yet short enough for the benchmark suite to be executed in a
reasonable amount of time.

The benchmarks attempt to minimize the influence of the operating system and
hardware and other processing running on the system. The type of operating
system and hardware used is recorded and the number of hardware threads used
is governable in each benchmark so performance can be normalized and optimized
for processor and memory type and thread-based parallelism. Operating system
process priority is increased on the benchmark process to reduce the impact of
other processes running on the system. A high precision real-time clock is
used to measure timings.  Timing variations are recorded in statistics
generated by running the benchmark pipelines multiple times.

The code for the ITK module, example benchmarks, and results presented in this
article can be found at
\url{https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKPerformanceBenchmarking}.
The code must be built against ITK 4.11.0 or newer, which includes improvements to
the resource recording classes.

The sections that follow describe in further detail first the classes in the
\code{PerformanceBenchmarking} ITK module and how they are used, then the
example benchmark suite.

\section{PerformanceBenchmarking Module}

The \code{PerformanceBenchmarking} module currently contains classes that
extend the \doxygen{RealTimeClock}, \doxygen{RealTimeProbe}, and
\doxygen{RealTimeProbesCollector} classes by also increasing the current
process's operating system priority. The \doxygen{HighPriorityRealTimeClock}
class uses operating system specific calls to increase the current process's
priority in its constructor and return it to its previous value in its
destructor. The \doxygen{HighPriorityRealTimeProbe} and
\doxygen{HighPriorityRealTimeProbesCollector} use a
\doxygen{HighPriorityRealTimeClock}.

A higher process priority increases the amount of computing resources allotted
to the benchmark process relative to the other processes running on the
system.

\begin{figure}

\itkcaption[Processor Priority Influence]{The impact of an increased process
priority when a parallel build of ITK is running in the background and when
only a few system processes are running. Times are given with mean +/- two
standard errors. In general, benchmark runtimes and their variability is more
closer to low load system results when the process priority is increased.}
\label{fig:ProcessorPriority}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ProcessorPriority} illustrates the difference in benchmarks
timings when an ITK build is running in the background on the system and when
only standard background processes are running. When only standard background
processes are running, the timing results are similar regardless of the
process priority. However, an elevated process priority reduces the increased
mean time and variance that occurs with a high system background load. The
parallel builds were executed with the \code{-j20} parallelism flag on a
system whose characteristics are given below.

\end{verbatim}

Example usage of the high priority timing classes is shown in the code below,
taken from the Median example benchmark. Note that this may effect other high
priority applications running on the system like graphical user interfaces,
network connections, etc. On Unix-like system, the process should be run as the
\code{root} user so it has adequate permission to elevate the priority; running
as a normal user will not result in a higher than normal process priority.

\section{Benchmark Suite}

\subsection{The Benchmarks}

The \code{examples} directory of the \code{ITKPerformanceBenchmarking}
repository contains a suite of ITK image processing pipelines.  The purpose of
these benchmarks is to be a timing metric for ITK processing pipelines.  They
are intended to help monitor computational performance as changes are made to
the toolkit and to measure the effect of internal changes to pipeline code.
To apply these benchmarks for comparisons of different algorithmic approaches
with the same analytic objective instead, greater care should be given to
ensure parameters of the pipelines are optimal. Additionally, attention is
required to establish that the results from competing algorithms are similar.

The benchmarks currently cover a variety of common processing pipelines that
require different parts of the toolkit. Additional benchmarks could be added
to benchmark other processing objectives and implementations in the toolkit.
Table~\ref{tab:Benchmarks} describes the current benchmarks, their processing
objective, and the features of the toolkit they exercise.

\label{tab:Benchmarks}
\end{table}

Image data used as inputs to the benchmarks were derived from the image shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:InputBrainWeb}.

\begin{figure}

When executed, each benchmark outputs system information and summary
statistical information. For example,

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{How to Build and Run}

The benchmark suite requires ITK 4.11.0 or newer and the
PerformanceBenchmarking module. The repository \code{examples/CMakeLists.txt}
file will configure and build both these dependencies by default. To build the
benchmarks:

\small
\begin{minted}[baselinestretch=1,fontsize=\footnotesize,linenos=false,bgcolor=ltgray]{bash}
$ git clone https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKPerformanceBenchmarking
$ mkdir Benchmarks-build
$ cd Benchmarks-build
$ cmake ../ITKPerformanceBenchmarking/examples/
$ make
\end{minted}
\normalsize

The benchmarks can be executed by running the \code{ctest} executable. When
the benchmark project is built, it also downloads required input data.

\small
\begin{minted}[baselinestretch=1,fontsize=\footnotesize,linenos=false,bgcolor=ltgray]{bash}
$ cd ITKBenchmarks-build/
$ ctest

      Start 10: LevelSetBenchmark
10/10 Test #10: LevelSetBenchmark ...................   Passed    9.26 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 10

Label Time Summary:
Filtering       =  22.06 sec (4 tests)
Registration    =  19.55 sec (3 tests)
Segmentation    =  21.34 sec (3 tests)

Total Test time (real) =  63.08 sec
\end{minted}
\normalsize

To see how a benchmark is called, run \code{ctest} with the \code{-V} flag.
The first argument is always the path to the output tab-separated-value file,
the second argument is the number of iterations to run the benchmark pipeline,
and the third argument is the number of threads to use; a value less than one
will use as many threads as there are logical cores available on the system.
